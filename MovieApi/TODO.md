[] Add Input Validation: Although we’ve validated our domain layer, it’s a good practice to validate data at the DTO level as well. This ensures that only valid data reaches the business logic. You can easily achieve this with the FluentValidation library. If you’re unfamiliar with it, I’ve written a comprehensive tutorial here.

[] Introduce Paging, Sorting, and Filtering: For larger datasets, adding features like paging, sorting, and filtering will significantly improve the performance and usability of your API. This makes it easy to retrieve specific subsets of data, particularly for endpoints that return large lists.

[] Dockerize the Application: Dockerizing your application makes it more portable and scalable. It simplifies deployments across different environments. If you’re new to Docker, check out my Getting Started Guide for Docker to learn how to containerize your .NET applications.

[] Deploy to the Cloud: Finally, take your application to the cloud! Whether it’s AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, deploying your API to the cloud enhances scalability, security, and manageability. Each cloud provider has its own deployment strategies, but they all offer a variety of services to support your application.
